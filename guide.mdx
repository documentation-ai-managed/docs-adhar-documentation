  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Frontmatter" icon="code">
    Edit the YAML frontmatter at the top:

</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Always include a `title` and `description` in frontmatter for better SEO and navigation.
</Callout>

## Structuring Your Documentation

Organize pages into folders and use sidebars for clear navigation.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="UI Method" icon="mouse-pointer">
    Drag pages into folders in the file tree. Create sidebars with:

    ```
    sidebar:
      - title: Guides
        pages:
          - guide.mdx
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CLI Method" icon="terminal">
    Use Adhar CLI to manage structure:

    <CodeGroup tabs="Bash,NPM">
```bash
adhar docs init --folder guides
adhar docs add guide.mdx --parent api
```
```bash
npm exec adhar docs create guide.mdx
```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

| Structure Type | Use Case | Example |
| -------------- | -------- | ------- |
| Flat Pages     | Small projects | All docs in root |
| Nested Folders | Large APIs | `/api/endpoint.mdx` |
| Sidebars       | Navigation | YAML-defined menus |

## Version Control and Updates

Integrate with Git for version control. Adhar syncs changes automatically.

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Git Workflow" default-open="true">
    1. Connect your repo in Settings.
    2. Edit docs and commit:

````bash
git add docs/guide.mdx
git commit -m "Update guide with new steps"
git push origin main
````

    Adhar pulls changes on webhook trigger.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Rollback Changes">
    Use Git history to revert:

    ```
    git revert HEAD~1
    git push
    ```
  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

Share previews with public links or collaborate live:

<CodeGroup tabs="Share CLI,Permissions">
```bash
adhar docs share guide.mdx --public
